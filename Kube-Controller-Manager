kubectl get nodes

### Node Controller
# Node monitor period = 5s --- every 5 seconds checks if nodes are ok
# Node Monitor Grace Period = 40s --- if node is not available for 40 seconds it marks it unreachable
# POD Eviction Timount = 5m --- waits for 5 minutes, if node is not up, it evicts pods to healthy node

### Replication Controller

kubectl get pods -n kube-system
> kube-controller-manager-master

# Options for kube-controller manager

cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml
# OR 
cat /etc/systemd/system/kube-controller-manager.service

ps -aux | grep kube-controller-manager
