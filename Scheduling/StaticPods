# Static Pods

# use case: deploy controlplane components (apiserver, etcd, controller-manager)

# you can place pod configs yaml to specified directory inside kubelet.service file

# kubelet works on the pod level
# looks at --pod-manifest-path for the location of the pods.yml files in the kubelet.service file
# another way is to put in kubelet.service --config=kubeconfig.yaml
# in the kubeconfig.yaml: staticPodPath: /etc/kubernetes/manifest/

# example: /etc/kubernetes/manifests/pod1.yaml

docker ps - to check for running containers
