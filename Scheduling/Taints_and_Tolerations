# Taints and Tolerations

# Taints are set on Nodes while Tolerations are set on Pods

kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:taint-effect
                                           |
                                            What happens to PODs that DO NOT TOLERATE this taint:
						- NoSchedule - Pod won't be scheduled on that node
					        - PreferNoSchedule - No guarantee that Pod won't be scheduled on that node
                                                   - NoExecute - New Pods won't be scheduled, existing Pods that can't handle taint will be evicted

kubectl taint nodes node1 app=blue:NoSchedule
