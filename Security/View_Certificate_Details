# View certificates in the existing cluster

# First thing to know is how the cluster was deployed, kubeadm or 'The Hard Way' using binaries
# Kubeadm automates installation and it has certificates is well known place while manual cluster installer can have certificates
# in different location, but they must be specified in the component service (kube-apiserver.service, ...)


# Cluster created by kubeadm

# most likely location of the file, can be different, but then it's specified in the /etc/kubernetes/manifest/apiserver.yaml

/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt

# check cert content
openssl x509 -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt -text -noout


# Troubleshooting issues

# Manually built cluster
journalctl -u etcd.service -l

# kubeadm built cluster
kubectl logs etcd-master

# View logs
docker ps -a
docker logs container_id

# Things to look if something is wrong with certificates

Subject: CN=kube-apiserver 	//check name of the component
x509v3 Subject Alternative Name: 	// check if it has all alternative names it should have

check validity
check issuer, it should be CA who issued the certificate
