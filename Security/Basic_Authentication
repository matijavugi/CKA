# Authentication 
# All user access is managed by kube-apiserver

# Static Password file 

user-detail.csv
passowrd,user,user-id,group1(optional)

# Import that csv file to kube-apiserver.service
--basic-auth-file=user-detail.csv

# OR

# in Kubeadm installation
# change kube-apiserver.yml located in /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml

- --basic-auth-file=user-detail.csv


# to authenticate user

curl -v -k https://master-node-ip:6443/api/v1/pods -u "user1:password123"


# Static Token File

user-detail.csv
k523kfdfsetgergs,user1,uid001,group1(optional)

# import token csv file same as password file

# to authenticate user via token


curl -v -k https://master-node-ip:6443/api/v1/pods --header "Authorization: Bearer k523kfdfsetgergs "


#### This is not recommended approach
#### Consider volume mount while providing the auth file in a kubeadm setup
#### Setup Role Based Authorization for the new users
