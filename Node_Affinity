# Node Affinity

# Ensure that pods are scheduled on to the right nodes

# Operators can be different (In, NotIn, Exists, ...)

# Two types of Node Affinity:
- requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution   (does not schedule pod if the pod doesn't match expressions)
- preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution  (if node doesn't match expressions it will be scheduled on some node)
