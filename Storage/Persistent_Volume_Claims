kubectl create -f pvc-definition.yaml

kubectl get pvc

# check the status, if PVC finds suitable PV, status will be bound

kubectl delete pvc myclaim

# Once PVC gets deleted and if not defined otherwise, PV won't be available for other PVC's until manually deleted
# by the admin
# This is due to persistantVolumeReclaimPolicy config which by default is set to Retain
# Other policies are Delete, which deletes PV and frees up storage
# Recycle policy will delete the data from PV and will make PV available to other PVC's
